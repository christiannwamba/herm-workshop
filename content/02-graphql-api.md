This section might sound intimidating because the title makes it look like we are about to go on a swirling journey of putting together a complex backend to power the complex application we are building.

This may come as a surprise to you, but this setup is the easiest part of this workshop. Building a robust backend is hard, add a modern tool like GraphQL to it, and it will start feeling like you have bitten more than you can chew or swallow. Fortunately, a lot of open source projects understand the power of GraphQL and don’t want you to give up yet because of the tediousness to provision it. This is why backend-as-a-service GraphQL services exist today.

So far, [Hasura](https://hasura.io) happens to be my favorite because of all the power features and extensibility that comes with it. We are going to set up a full-fleshed GraphQL API with Hasura in this section and here are the key features you will see

What is going on in this chapter?


- Install Docker (don’t worry, it’s easy these days)
- Provision a Hasura-backed backend
- Create and manage tables for structured data
- Table relationships
- Testing Queries and Mutations
